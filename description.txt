F.A.Q:
 - Q: I have two or more supported mods installed, which of all of them will predominate in the presence app name status?
 - A: Supported mods work on the following priority order: [CalamityMod, The Stars Above, Gensokyo, Vanilla].
 - Q: I have two or more supported mods installed, will the non-priority mod bosses/biomes/events display on the presence details?
 - A: Yes! The application name will remain with the priority mod's name, but still, all the non-priority mod bosses/biomes/events will display correctly.
 - Q: Some images just don't display correctly on my discord status, is this a bug?
 - A: As the mod has recently come out, some of the Discord assets are still being uploaded, this doesn't need any mod update to be fixed. All the assets will work in a few days (if there're non working assets, of course).
