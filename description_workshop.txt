[b]F.A.Q:[/b]
 - [u]Q: I have two or more supported mods installed, which of all of them will predominate in the presence app name status?[/u]
 - [i]A: Supported mods work on the following priority order: [CalamityMod, The Stars Above, Gensokyo, Vanilla].[/i]
 - [u]Q: I have two or more supported mods installed, will the non-priority mod bosses/biomes/events display on the presence details?[/u]
 - [i]A: Yes! The application name will remain with the priority mod's name, but still, all the non-priority mod bosses/biomes/events will display correctly.[/i]
 - [u]Q: Some images just don't display correctly on my discord status, is this a bug?[/u]
 - [i]A: As the mod has recently come out, some of the Discord assets are still being uploaded, this doesn't need any mod update to be fixed. All the assets will work in a few days (if there're non working assets, of course).[/i]
